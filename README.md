# PhotoDBwithJS
This project was originally intended to be a photograph database, hence the name, and I hope it will be eventually.  I found that for my present skill level, uploading photos and applying captions and metadata was too ambitious.  I have left an "Add Photos" link in my nav bar for this future purpose.

Presently the project is a CRUD application using Mongo, Express, Node and EJS as a template handler. The project offers resources related to folklife and culture of North Africa and the Middle East.  Users can add books on the regions to a bibliography.  There are also photo collections displayed with a carousel and lightbox.

CRUD 
GET request
POST request triggered by Form element
PUT request triggered by fetch & javaScript: Updates latest bibliography entry with the word Levant in the description.
DELETE request: delete bibliography items with tldr in the description
